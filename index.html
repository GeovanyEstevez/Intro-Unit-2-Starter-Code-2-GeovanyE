      <h2>Racial Profiling</h2>

      <p class="sections"><em> In America Racial Profiling has been around for quite a while even after the civil
          rights movement which was about 50 years ago. Racial profiling has been in decline as of recently however at
          one
          point it was really big around the year 2013, it may not happen somuch nowadays but it is still a huge issue
          that should be addressed. </em></p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <!--Add text, images, and links for section 2 below!-->
      <p class="sections"><em>The reason racial profiling was really impactful back in these times and still is today is
          due to the reason that innocent people were seen as criminals even though these citizens could've been jsut
          law abidding people trying to get through in life and then police just randomly pull them over just due to
          their skin. Racial profiling may have lead to a lot of false guilty verdicts in which the person couldnt've
          protected themselves. </em></p>

      <h2>How to stop it</h2>
      <!--Add text, images, and links for section 3 below!-->
      <p class="sections"><em> As a community we can work together to stop Racial Profiling completely and fully stop
          our law enforcement on arresting people due to their skin color or heritage by just abidding by what the law
          enforcement have. To say though noticeably be mad we could always report the officer(s) for their wrong doing.
          We will always have the freedom and right to say what we want and must always remember that we are innocent
          until proven guilty therefore if you know your innocent you will most likely win and have the ability to get
          these officers out of their law enforcement positions due to their criminal acts. You can learn more in
          stopping Racial Profiling in this following link. <a
